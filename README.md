# Online Auction Platform

This is an online auction platform built with **Next.js**. Users can post items, place bids, and receive notifications when they are outbid. The backend is powered by PostgreSQL, with a smooth integration of **Drizzle ORM** and a polished frontend using **ShadCN UI**. User authentication is handled via **auth.js**, and notifications are sent using **Knock**. Item photos are stored in **Cloudflare R2 Bucket**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Run the Docker container for the database:

docker compose up

### 2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

### 3. Run the maintenance script (to update the auction when the end time comes):

```bash
npx tsx -r dotenv/config scripts/mark_winners.ts
```

### 4. Open the application in your browser:

http://localhost:3000

-   **Notifications:** Users are notified through **Knock** when they are outbid.
